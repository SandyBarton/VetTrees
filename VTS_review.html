  <p> Chris was very professional and helpful. He came on the day agreed upon, even though he had some challenges. He stayed in communication so we knew what to expect and he got the job done when he said he would. He was great to work with, and economical too. I thought he was worth the money spent</p>

<p>When I first hired Chris to do our leaning pine tree I was impressed that I didnâ t need to worry about a boom truck driving on my lawn. The fact that he does his trimming/cutting using ropes is absolutely old skool and that really impressed me. The quote he gives you is what you pay Iâ ll hire him over any other local services on my town. To watch someone pull themselves and their equipment up into a tree using ropes is an experience you have to see. This guy loves what he does and it shows.</p>
